Using an OOP and multi-file approach, I built a clone of the classic game asteroids.

There is no end-state or score other than game-over if you collide with an asteroid.

The main goal was to program something with only light guidance and 0 AI or copilot.

To play, clone the repository and ensure python and pygame are installed.
```
 sudo apt install python3
 sudo apt install python3-pygame
```
After cloning to a directory run main.py.

```
 python3 main.py
```
